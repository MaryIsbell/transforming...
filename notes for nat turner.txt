[footnote]Here, Turner is talking about how he supposedly told other children stories that happened before his lifetime and therefore should have no way of knowing them. From the early stages of his life, Turner’s mind did not seem to work like the other children’s. Thomas Wentworth Higginson was a scholar who was alive at the time the rebellion occurred and wrote an article in 1861, also the start of the civil war, on his interpretations of the events that occurred in 1831. Higginson was a supporter of John Brown, who was an American abolitionist leader. Higginson was also an American Unitarian minister, author, soldier, and abolitionist who was active in the American Abolition movement during the 1840s and 1850s, identifying himself with militant abolitionism. Higginson believed that Nat Turner’s poor mental state was with him throughout his life, not just due to being enslaved. Higginson says, “He had, by his own account, felt himself singled out from childhood for some great work; and he had some peculiar marks on his person, which, joined to his great mental precocity, were enough to occasion, among his youthful companions, a superstitious faith in his gifts and destiny.” It appears that Higginson believes that Turner’s childhood played a significant role in his development of being mentally unstable. <strong>Citation</strong>: Higginson, Thomas Wentworth. “Nat Turner’s Insurrection.” <em>The Atlantic</em> November 7, 2011.

[footnote]Nat Turner admits here that his mind was always in a state of constant restlessness. He also understands that most people likely thought all his attention was strictly on religion, and although it mainly was, he insists that his attention was directed at everything he saw and heard. Joseph Drexler-Dreis is a scholar with both a Belgian cultural background and American cultural background. This allows for a variety of interpretations from different cultural backgrounds.

[footnote]What Nat Turner is describing here is a clear visual hallucination as well as an auditory hallucination. He talked about having a vision where he saw both black and white spirits and how he heard a voice as a part of the vision. Heather E.

Lacey is a 2011 graduate from Pheonix College in Arizona where she concentrated in history.

[footnote]Nat Turner is talking about how he would receive messages from the heavens. In this instance, he says he heard a noise, and the Spirit then appeared to him telling him the Serpent was loosened. Turner took this as a sign that he must fight the serpent.

[footnote]Nat Turner took the eclipse of the sun on a particular day in February as a sign to prepare himself to begin his rebellion of slaying his enemies with their own weapons. He also had four other slaves in mind who he believed would be the best help to accomplish his plan. Higginson states, “The religious hallucinations narrated in his Confession seem to have been as genuine as the average of such things and are very well expressed.” The important thing here is that in 1861 Higginson referred to Turner’s religious beliefs and actions as hallucinations.

He also lists in detail the weaponry available for him and the other slaves to use. When deciding what motivated Nat Turner’s rebellion, Lacey stays away from the religious aspects. For a complete introduction to Heather Lacey please refer to footnote 4.

[footnote] David F. Allmendinger, Jr. explains that “the principal responsibility for conducting Nat’s preliminary examination on 31 October—for nearly two hours—fell to Colonel Trezvant.” This quote makes me question why Gray stated that the confession given on the stand by the colonel was the one “as given to Mr. Gray” when Trezvant had his own investigation of Turner, as assigned by the court. Also, in the court minutes, it states, “James Trezvant being sworn said that Mr. James W. Parker and himself were the Justices before whom the prisoner was examined previous to his commitment.” This quote corroborates that Trezvant’s confession talked about on the stand was the one given to him by Nat Turner, not the confession talked about above that was obtained by Mr. Gray.
