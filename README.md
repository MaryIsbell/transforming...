# [The Confessions of Nat Turner](https://unewhaven.pressbooks.pub/transforming/)

This repository contains files for an [in-process documentary edition of The Confessions of Nat Turner](https://unewhaven.pressbooks.pub/transforming/), which means that we are in the process of representing a particular physical book as accurately as possible. We work toward this goal by regularly referring to the page images of the source text and noting any errors we find in the transcription. This repository contains files for the edition being published in Pressbooks and will be updated after each semester it is used in the classroom. 

# About the Source Text
This edition builds on the work done by the Documenting the American South (DocSouth) initiative in 1999. DocSouth produced an edition of The Confessions in accordance with the Text Encoding Initiative and generated an HTML file for online reading. We include details about the team who did this work below. We have used their HTML file for our edition, and you can view the difference between their HTML file and our first iteration in our github repository. We have retained their choice to render errors in the source as red text. We have removed the red formatting of notes that were included in the first edition.This edition also builds on the work done by a team at the UNC-Chapel Hill library that scanned the same copy of The Confessions for inclusion in The Internet Archive. We have not included detailed metadata for each page image here, instead linking to Internet Archive, where that information has been carefully described.

There are many copies of The Confessions of Nat Turner by Thomas Gray published in Baltimore by Lucas and Deaver in 1831. This open edition aims to represent, as accurately as possible, the particular copy described below:
